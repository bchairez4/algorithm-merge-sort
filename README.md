# algorithm-merge-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the merge sort algorithm.
The input is a std::vector of elements, of a comparative type, that acts as an array and the output is the sorted array.

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks an array down into single element pieces and merges itself back in the proper order.
This implementation of merge sort uses auxillary space in order to temporarily store the broken down pieces of the array.
